						The next four years I spent learning how to learn.<br>
						Engineering school introduced me to higher levels of mathematics, statistics, critical thinking, and problem solving.  I learned Matlab (C-style)
						probramming as well as a deeper level of MS Excel proficciency. My Visual Basic skills came back to me as I used them to create nice macros to run within 
						Excel.

						In both of these engineering internships, I setup and managed the data collection, transfer, and storage of flight data for the UAV test flights.
						The second year I set up automatic data reports that could be generated from the flight data. Based on the tools I knew at the time, I set all
						of this up using Excel and integrated VBA macros.

						<strong>Cummins Inc.<br>Indiana<br></strong>
						Right out of college, I jumped into mechanical engineering as a design engineer for Cummins Inc.  I was on the forefront of pushing newer clean diesel
						engines. During my 6 years as a design engineer, I created 3D models of engine components, had them prototyped, tested, and sent into full production.
						Beyond growing my engineering skills, I learned critical program management and schedule tracking skills.  I used my Excel and macro experience to
						develop powerful tools for myself and my colleagues. I have been working as the last few years as a validation mechanical engineer, planning, testing,
						breaking, and fixing engine hardware.<br>
						Inefficiencies drive me crazy.  I started making solutions to anything that slowed me down.  I made some HTA tools and shorrcut windows to help with 
						mundane tasks. A few of these tools were quite complex, with installation (and uninstallation) scripts, revision tracking, auto-updates, usage and help
						websites, etc.  More details can be found in my portfolio page (under the Engineering Tools section).

						<strong>Online<br></strong>
						During paternity leave with my two children and with the limited free time that I had, I spent it studying various programming langauges and concepts. Initially I wanted
						to just learn Python to apply the language in my engineering work.  I kept getting more interested the more I learned.  I learned about Free and Open Source software and 
						got really into privacy and security.  See my next timeline item...  I thought it would be fun to host my own website, and learned the basics of web development too.<br>
						Over time, my interest kept growing. I kept finding more and more resources to lear online.  I'm currenly half way through Harvard's CS50 online course and am getting a
						great overview into computer science.

						<strong>Nextcloud<br></strong>
						I went through a phase where I challenged myself to see how much I could get away from the big web companies.  Personal data collection and selling of user information for 
						targeted advertising is not the model of internet usage that I want to see. Until something better arises, I wanted to see how much I could self host myself.  I tried out  
						<a class=hiddenlink href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> as a free service then realized how easy it is to set up and self-host. I purchased an old
						laptop, wiped Windows from it and replaced it with Linux. Learning each tool along the way, I now have an operational home server running a self-hosted Nextcloud platform.
						I now keep all of my personal files, notes, contacts, to-do kanban, and calendar within the walls of my own house.  Well, I still keep encrypted monthly back-ups of my data
						on a hard drive and uploaded to cloud file storage.
