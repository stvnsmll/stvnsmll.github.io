			An unexpected journey??? Yup. After nearly 10 years as a mechanical engineer I realized that my passion is programming.
			I would make myself tools to use in my engineering work - ranging from simple scripts to more complex programs.

			Eventually I got to the point where I rolled out some of my tools to other users.  With this came installation 
			(and uninstallation) scripts, revision tracking, pushed updates, usage tracking, a website for help and instructions, 
			among other complexities.

			<br><br>
			
			I've enjoyed my time as a mechanical engineer, but I found myself always thinking about my tools and wanting to spend 
			my work hours adding new features and bug fixing. Frequently while programming, I may glance at the clock and wonder 
			where the hours went.

			<br><br>
			
			While at home on paternity leave with my first child, I used the hours of rocking to teach myself Python basics. When 
			home with my second, I learned web development languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).  I've tried to find ways to 
			practice and develop my skills and really had some fun with 
			<a class=hiddenlink href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/about" target="_blank">Advent of Code 2019</a>
			at the recommendation of my sister and brother-in-law (both programmers).

			<div class="shoutout">
			Big shoutout to my little sis! Although you could have easily excelled in Law, you quit to pursue programming. You've 
			been an inspiration and motivation for me to follow what I love to do too.
			</div>

			<br><br>
			
			Cruise around the site to see more about my portfolio, education, blog, and hobbies. Any feedback about this 
			site or any of projects is always welcome!

					<h3>Engineering Efficiency Tools</h3>
					<p>
					Here are the tools that I developed for use in my mechanical engineering work. Most scripts are quite simple and were written in vbscript and/or HTA.
					They were designed for use on Windows machines only, and require internal network access to fully function. I've included snapshots of any GUI and 
					description of what each program does.

					<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
					<p>
					<strong>Home Cloud:</strong> First Linux, then Docker, MySQL, Apache server,and finally Nextcloud. During all of this I had to learn about httpS, DNS, 
					and other details around web server housing and internet security. This was a fun personal project that I love and use daily!<br>
					<strong>Childcare Share:</strong> This will be multi-platform web app to help track and manage babysitting among families. <small>[under development]</small>

					<h3>Coursework</h3>
					<p>
					I've pulled a few examples from my programming courses to show the skillsets that I have developed over the past few years. There is a wode range in 
					complexity that I share here.

					<h3>Advent of Code</h3>
					<p>
					This past winter (2019), I really enjoyed the challenge of AoC using Python. I completed 11 of thr 25 puzzles, getting 19 stars (during the challenge). 
					I went back and completed the rest later in the year as time permitted. <br>Hopefully as you look through my solutions you can see how I think and solve 
					problems.

						Right out of college, I jumped into mechanical engineering as a design engineer for Cummins Inc.  I was on the forefront of pushing newer clean diesel
						engines. During my 6 years as a design engineer, I created 3D models of engine components, had them prototyped, tested, and sent into full production.
						Beyond growing my engineering skills, I learned critical program management and schedule tracking skills.  I used my Excel and macro experience to
						develop powerful tools for myself and my colleagues. I have been working as the last few years as a validation mechanical engineer, planning, testing,
						breaking, and fixing engine hardware.<br>
						Inefficiencies drive me crazy.  I started making solutions to anything that slowed me down.  I made some HTA tools and shorrcut windows to help with 
						mundane tasks. A few of these tools were quite complex, with installation (and uninstallation) scripts, revision tracking, auto-updates, usage and help
						websites, etc.  More details can be found in my portfolio page (under the Engineering Tools section).

						<strong>Online<br></strong>
						During paternity leave with my two children and with the limited free time that I had, I spent it studying various programming langauges and concepts. Initially I wanted
						to just learn Python to apply the language in my engineering work.  I kept getting more interested the more I learned.  I learned about Free and Open Source software and 
						got really into privacy and security.  See my next timeline item...  I thought it would be fun to host my own website, and learned the basics of web development too.<br>
						Over time, my interest kept growing. I kept finding more and more resources to lear online.  I'm currenly half way through Harvard's CS50 online course and am getting a
						great overview into computer science.

						<strong>Nextcloud<br></strong>
						I went through a phase where I challenged myself to see how much I could get away from the big web companies.  Personal data collection and selling of user information for 
						targeted advertising is not the model of internet usage that I want to see. Until something better arises, I wanted to see how much I could self host myself.  I tried out  
						<a class=hiddenlink href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a> as a free service then realized how easy it is to set up and self-host. I purchased an old
						laptop, wiped Windows from it and replaced it with Linux. Learning each tool along the way, I now have an operational home server running a self-hosted Nextcloud platform.
						I now keep all of my personal files, notes, contacts, to-do kanban, and calendar within the walls of my own house.  Well, I still keep encrypted monthly back-ups of my data
						on a hard drive and uploaded to cloud file storage.
