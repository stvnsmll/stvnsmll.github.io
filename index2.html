			An unexpected journey??? Yup. After nearly 10 years as a mechanical engineer I realized that my passion is programming.
			I would make myself tools to use in my engineering work - ranging from simple scripts to more complex programs.

			Eventually I got to the point where I rolled out some of my tools to other users.  With this came installation 
			(and uninstallation) scripts, revision tracking, pushed updates, usage tracking, a website for help and instructions, 
			among other complexities.

			<br><br>
			
			I’ve enjoyed my time as a mechanical engineer, but I found myself always thinking about my tools and wanting to spend 
			my work hours adding new features and bug fixing. Frequently while programming, I may glance at the clock and wonder 
			where the hours went.

			<br><br>
			
			While at home on paternity leave with my first child, I used the hours of rocking to teach myself Python basics. When 
			home with my second, I learned web development languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).  I’ve tried to find ways to 
			practice and develop my skills and really had some fun with 
			<a class=hiddenlink href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/about" target="_blank">Advent of Code 2019</a>
			at the recommendation of my sister and brother-in-law (both programmers).

			<div class="shoutout">
			Big shoutout to my little sis! Although you could have easily excelled in Law, you quit to pursue programming. You’ve 
			been an inspiration and motivation for me to follow what I love to do too.

			Cruise around the site to see more about my portfolio, education, blog, and hobbies. Any feedback about this 
			site or any of projects is always welcome!
